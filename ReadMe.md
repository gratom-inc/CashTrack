## Gratom CashTrack

This is a cash tracking tool that aims to integrate several sources of transactions data into a single consistent exportable stream, and verify that all debits and credits properly cancel out (i.e. add up to zero).

This is currently still being built out, but will eventually be shipped to the public for commercial use (most likely on a subscription model) once it reaches a level of maturity and usefulness.

One of the Kotlin source files in here is a symlink pointing to a file outside of this repository (for privacy), so this project will not compile for anyone else right now.
